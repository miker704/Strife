# PATCH NOTES

## Future additions and pending changes
  
- Preparing to update to React v18
  - Changes will require fixing setInvervals, setTimeouts, modals that popup on within components other than the ModalMangerContainer.

- Action and process flow of banning and kicking users from a server or a dmServer will be reworked and
    be optimized by the Core Cable anaylzing the location of said user deciding the best course of action on whether
    a user should re-receive all their dm/servers or just a single one. The hope is also to reduce and eliminate problem areas on re-renders such as channel messages re-rendering a previous or newly received server/channels messages for half a second before reverting back to the proper messages.
  - many more

### DmServer Plans

- Dmserver can manually be deleted via clicking the x icon next to it (creator only, leave the dmServer if a member)
  - (Anticipated) DmServers that become group chats (3-10 users) removing a user when they are 3 remaining deletes the dmServer in order to prevent a   duplicate chat of the same individuals regardless if it exists already or not. Change will be to check if there is a dm between those remaining two users if it exists the dmServer will be deleted if it doesnt deletion is aborted and the 3rd member that was being removed will be removed normally.
  - One to One chats when clicking on the new show user profile icon will render a profile card of the user.

### Server Plans

- Server Banners, Channel and Server descriptions which can be vieweds on the explore servers page
  - Explore Servers page will render a servers banner and server description if the server owner has added them instead of the default description and
  banner (if server has an avatar it gets rendered as a banner in the explore servers page)
- Servers will now have their theme type assigned via the backend,
  -Thus the channel creation for them will be moved to the backend to reduce redux calls for all the channels created and just receive the server itself which will give all the channels with it.

#### Channels

- Ability to give channels a description.
- Allow channels to be private, thus requiring an invite to that channel
- Channel Categories.

### Messaging as Whole

- Be able to message chain (reply to a comment)
- @ a user/ mention a user - (with upgrading to rails 7 this will be more hassle free to implement correctly)
- Inviting a user as Non Demo or admin account should work normally as in it creates a dm and with an invite to join.
- emojis
- Message/ notification inbox intergration
- Default message for channels and dm servers to be changed to match more of discords.
- Allow messages to send images
- Allow a url parser, anaylze if a text matches a url and provide a small modal/ component to wrap out send
link if possible.
- Allow url parser to embed youtube videos.

### General/Util

- Attempts to address draggable containers
- Context menus across the application
- Add Moz kit values to every style as FireFox is currently now unsupported as many styles glitch out in the browser. Microsoft edge, and Google Chrome are the only support browsers.

### Video / Voice Calling

- Re-add just voice only calling to dmServers.
- work on creating a unique room for individuals to talk in a dmServer also allowing more than users to talk at once current limits is 1 to 1 conversations.
- same will be implemented for servers, Servers have voice and video call disabled as the current state of the app interferes with this working and
the need to create a private room is need to prevent unwanted members from entering a call. (note multi web call where previously possible but could not be done on command and would randomly occur when the goal was never to 3 or more callers at once also due to certain limitations of rails and deployment platforms normal one to one chat is already stressful on app performance and webRTC has given multiple warnings on the number of ice canidates it can process even though the api can handle many callers at onces)

## PATCH NOTES v4.00 - 5/1/2023 - OnGoing

## Major Changes and Fixes

    - Added the use of Material UI libraries for easier and more stable components for inputs, forms, radio buttons, etc.
    - Added Alias for MUI libraries in webpack "@mui/material/" is mapped to the folder "@mui/material/modern" which contains all MUIs components for modern browser versions instead of grabbing the legacy version of the components for the normal unmapped path "@mui/material/".
    - Addressed issue with speed of application and rendering of components such as the channel settings modal which uses MUI components, importing and using one component even something small such as a button or even a form label from the MUI library causes a rendering slow down. After some investigations it was determined that the rendering speed for channel settings modal went from 0.5-3ms to around 3 - 9 seconds. Optimizations included removal of the majority of MUI components that used the sx={{}} style prop containing more than 5 styles as it was determined that sx prop has a performance overhead at times although not noticeable in most cases, it also helps reduce code clutter and increase readability, now components with a large amount of styles are moved into a styled component which at first before using the sx prop , worked fine in designing components but for some odd reason would not allow proper functionality of the component, problem was that the component was wrapped in the functional component that was calling it in the render. so the fix was to seperate the styled component from the functional component and call it inside the functional component and the styled component works correctly. these have given slight increases to performance. but the slow down was still noticeable, production build of the app removed the performace overhead and the app works at its normal speeds but in development components being called to render in that contain mui components are extremely slow to appear, after extensive investigation the cause was mui styling engine which was the emotion style engine, upon calling to render some component containing a mui component the header tags would generate a large amount of style tags containing the styles of the mui components and the customized styles which override the default mui styles.  Inorder to speed up rendering the styling engine for mui has been switched from emotion to "@mui/styled-engine-sc" which also allows better rendering of styled component types and eliminates the generation of style tags in the header tags of the application when a mui component loads in. this was address by adding  "@mui/styled-engine": "@mui/styled-engine-sc" as alias in the webpack config file.

## C0R3 @P! glitches and bugs addressed and added changes

### Glitches and bugs Addressed

    - Passed -1 as channel type to allow the subtext in create channel modal to not appear when opening it from the channel drop down container.

#### User Security && Application Security

- A potential risky html/jsx code has been addressed in Channel Drop Down modal. Prior the modal would return avaliable options that can be selected based on the level of authorization the user has either they are a server member or the server owner it will render options that they have access to. However the modal returns Un-Authorized options as invisible, to the U.I. but it is present in the html which can be exploited and can possibly crash the app if enable. The reason for this is the modal returns the options while deciding whether or not to hide them or not. This has been addressed by having the decisons for those options decided before the returning jsx is returned.

- Fixed certain forms and buttons in delete channel modal from being XSS attacked or fall victim to form hijacking.
- Added Protection features to prevent XSS attacks and form hi-jacking on delete server messages of other users.

To prevent only authorized options to be rendered in both the html file structure and the u.i. the options are decided before the returning jsx. prior the returning jsx decided to hide which ever options it needed leaving said option to be hidden by styling it to be invisible instead of not rendering it at all.

    - Fixed escape listener bug on delete server modal where clicking outside the modal to close it causes a bug that refuses to bind to any sub modal
     hence clicking escape will close both the sub and main modal. issue is due to an old method of removing listeners when opening a sub modal and adding listeners to that sub modal a set time out is used to readd the listener to the main modal upon closing the sub modal however the timing is what causes the bug so removing the settime out fixes this. settimouts are added to the sub modal to allow the closing animation to fully play.

      explore public servers, create a server, download apps, bubbles if these bubbles are clicked the bubble itself does not retain 30% border radius or the color changes for a selected bubble. Addressed by using a similar approach to the home bubble for explore servers bubble attaching the guild link to a condition to ensure the selected bubble shows as selected while at the explore servers page.
      Also by using the ui state rto check which modals are currently open either download apps, or create a server if so set a custom class to show the bubble that is is selected and active and "pop" the bubble when the modal is closed this works when in the explore servers page of in any other server clicking on the modal bubbles allows those bubbles to expand as well while still having the current server bubble expanded at the same time.

    - Add state vars to hold error messages when friend requests fail in add friends page to maintain the error messages returned from redux state to remain on the DOM when the Friendship error modal appears/disappears as the modal clears the error state in redux wrapping it into state allows it to remain and by shown after the Friendship error modal disappears. 
    - Add a heavy modified search functionality for the input handler for the add friends input field in the add friends page component. It detects when typing a hashtag and prevents the user from entering any non number value, only allowing the user to enter a 4 digit number representing the users $TR!F3 tag. When the user deletes the hashtag from the input field it allows them to once again type anything.
    Adding a # in the input proceeded with any number less than 4 digits pressing any non number will reset the tag input deleting the input past the hashtag placeing a hash tag in between the text will remove text after the first hashtag as this represents and ensures that the hash is to indicate tag input and what ever is after the hash is suspected to be the tag. The input field max size has been set to be 37 chars in length. 32 for the username (which is the max username length) and 5 characters for the # and the 4 digit tag number. inputing the hash after the username modifies the maxlength of the inputfield to then proceed to by 4 characters more than the current input text unless it reaches over 37 chars long. Example default max length is 37 inputing a username of 10 chars long then adding a hash
    will now restrict the input to become 15 chars long with 11 chars taken by the username and hash and the remaining 4 will be the tag number which the input will then until the hash is removed take only a 4 digit number adding any non numeric character between these numbers will delete the input till the hashtag reseting the tag input removing the hashtag allows other chars to be entered again and the 
    input max length resizes back to 37. if a hash tag is entered as the 36 or 37th character the input max length will not change to prevent an submission of something that wouldnt be successful anyways. 
    - In Add Friends page added the ability when inputing a hashtag to then reveal a shadow placeholder element that shows the user a hint of what they should be typing adding the # then reveals a placeholder of 4 "0"s hinting the user to input the tag number of the user as the user procceds to input numbers the placeholder will shrink the number of zeros depending on the how many numbers the user has currently inputed. when the user removes the hash tag the shadow placeholder is removed.
    - Added Red border color around the input field in the add friends page if a friend request attempt was unsuccessful.
    - Added Green border color around the input field in the add friends page if a friend request attempt was successful.
    - Added the feature when a friend request is successful to show a success message containing the username#$TR!F3_tag_id of the user the current user has successfully sent a friend request to.
    - Added the functionality to reset state holding redux state errors and clear redux error state, and reset any error or success style modifiers and messages when the user inputs any text into the input field in add friends page this function is called in submission blocker which checks if the input has text or not and enables or disables the submit button depending on if the input field has data or not and the input handler also calls the function if needed.

    scrollbars to be modified if a theme is switched without have to manually restyle each scrollbar.

    - Moved old version start conversation modal to deprecated.
    - Moved a version of start conversation modal to deprecated that features an implementation of _live_search that induces a filter to filter out object which removes the the old version of live search that hides elements using is-hidden however do to scertain condtions involved in rendering (elements are rendered under a header of their type which causes 5 instances to of live search to run at once and cannot be concat to be one list as rendering under the type header is not possible and with the 5 instance method is to slow around 2 seconds to filter from blank to 1 character) .

    - Added a working Quick Switch functionality for start conversation model that uses the old version of livesearch that use query selecting and  using is-hidden styles to hide thje non matching elements from view but still keep them on the DOM this allows this search method superior in performance than the new livesearch method as the new method filters out the lists and re renders the list on the DOM. While the old method just changes the styling and removes uits display property. Due to that large amount of data and the need for mutliple seperate lists make the filter rendering method to slow and performance heavy for use in this modal will the is-hidden method has blazing performance on large data sets that are rendered into MULTIPLE LISTS as one instance of the function can run and tackle multiple elements all kinds if they match a query selector. the Quick Switch functionality is to allow quick hopping to a certain object inorder to find results faster than scrolling through a large list of data. it is basically a catergory filter by pressing  one of these !,@,#,$,* keys as the first character basically filters out all items that are not associated with that type. using data-* attribute to assign these query keys to list items for quick filtering.
    - Added a working method of arrow tracking with the mouse and hopping to the first element in the search results in start converstation modal. The real version of this in discord uses complex listeners and various conditions cause arrow misalignment so a version that allows basic arrow movement was implemented and certain cases where notable scenerios where arrows would be outside the model have been taken care of by just rejecting the attempt to move the arrows.

    - Added input validation to the message input to check if the message length is 0 or is of the length of 0 after removing white spaces in server user options modal before sending the message.

    - The orginal delete friendship function that now handles friend status of 3 in server user options modal now closes the modal and opens the confirm delete friend modal to confirm the deletion of the friend.

    - Added conditional protection to ban user from a server in server user options modal which is to check to see if the server Member being viewed is still a member before attempting to ban them from the server. fetches the server member is still or is a member of the Server if true proceed with the ban, else it is likely they have left the Server and if that is the case close the modal instead.
    - Added 4 roles names with dedicated role colors 3 which are randomly generated for server members while 1 is dedicated to only the server owner themselves.
    - Edited the handle popup to function in dmserver members list for passing to server user options modal which decides the placement of the modal passed on the where the member that was clicked on is in the list and place the modal close that the users name. this checks for screen sizes of 4k or 1080p and decides the placement. Since Server User options modal has been redesigned the modal has no one size but multiple sizes previously they are only 2 dedicated sizes reaching 238px to 396px. This range was for both servers and dmserver versions of the modal. However the redesign makes a max and minimum sizes 
    different for servers and dmservers themselves the server version reaches from 450px - 670px which at the max consumes most of the screen. so calculations are now different for both versions the dmserver version of handling placement takes into account of the minimum and max sizes possible of the dmserver version of the modal.
    - Edited the handle popup top function for placement of the server users options modal in server members list for changes related to the same problems for the dmserver version of this function for servers the placement of the modal on 1080p screens will 90% of the time be at the highest position due to the potential max size of the modal can reach over 96% of the screen size for 1080p screens however for 4k screens the modal handles placement more elegantly by placing the modal near the server members name in the members list.
    - Passed a rawpopup top variable that grabs the non modified top value to server user options modal in both dmserver and server member list components.
    - Created a listener in server user options modal that listens for when the user resizes the window or moves the window to a screen with different resolution/size and readjust the placement of the modal by rescaling using the same popup top functions from the dmserver and server member list components check what type of modal it is whether server or dmserver dedicated and using the raw pop up top value recalculate the placement including being able to readjust when being dragged from 4k to 1080 and vice versa and when the window is resized also added media query function to handle thw width and placement when the window is resized smaller than the full screen size of the monitor it is being viewed which works in tandum with the listener function while the listener function repositions the top attribute of the modal based on the height of the current screen while the media query handle the width of the screen and resizes the modal and shifts it to the right when the width of the browser is shrunk.

    - Added refresh loading screen that spawns a random loading screen style and animation upon hitting refresh anywhere within the app by hitting F5 or 
    hitting the browser refresh button.
    - Fixed a mass stall glitch when inviting a user to server the following happens user invited gains membership to server along with memberships to all channels of said server then a message is created welcoming that user to the server. when creating an invite using a dmserver passing all of the members create a welcome message. when ever a message is created it re-renders the server to render the new member added to the server. this causes alot of re-renders which stall the app and bottleneck the database. In Order to reduce unnecessary re-rendering due to injection of multiple server members via passing dmserver members as an invite instead of re-rendering for each message create for each member (Welcome @username to server_name) have one message containing all the members and push it to re-render the server to a minimim rate of around 1-3 server dispatches.
    - Removed Invite to Server Modal from modal manager.
    - Deployed invite to server modal from server main container.
    - Removed Props.closeModal() from invite to server modal and used a state callback function to open and close it while using the props.openmodalwithprops() function to pass props needed to use it as normal.
    - Wrapped invite to server modal with REACT PORTAL wrapped portal around all conditional renders of it.
    - Provided a new condtional rendering for invite to server modal where since the component is now mounted to the same level as the server container it has direct access to the params property by itself without the need to pass it as props to it however if the user is somehow routed in only serverId and not channelId prevent the requests for receiving the channel, friendships, and dms of the user and display the modal in a version where there is no data. This occurs when the route is /$/channels/:serverId instead of /$/channels/:serverId/:channelId and the modal is opened from channel drop down modal. since there is no current channel an id of -1 is used instead if that pass id is -1 set a new prop type that represents a special version of the modal to handle this situation and basically skip all fetches and render a plain version of the modal.- Removed Invite to Server Modal from modal manager.

    - Removed user settings modal from modal manager.
    - Deployed user settings at the root level.
    - reworked REACT PORTAL API Wrapper which now has some protections including being able to generate a portal if no portal element exists and renders the modal within the portal and delete it after the modal is closed using a useLayoutEffect. Also React Portal now takes in a classNameId which is then used when creating a portal gate to be added along with the wrapperid to form both the id and classname attribute of the portal gate. Also depending on the classnameId it will generate a specific type of portal and render it at aa specific position, These changes allow for more secure and error free rendering and allow but submodals and setting modals to be rendered.

    - Fixed a performance issue in channel settings modal when svg icon "Chevron Icon" which is used as the icon for the mui select components to indicate drop down menu open, is converted to a mui svgIcon component. The problems is that this they of component most be declared outside the component it will be used in as since is takes in props (in this case mui controller props, controlled by the mui library) react renderd this icon as a component itself and declaring it within a component and using it causes lag due to this component takes in props and the component its delcared in takes props too, tasks such as text input slow it down. delcaring and converting the icon into a mui svg component allows it to render faster and stop lag. 
    - Removed spinning cube animation in channel settings modal as the likely hood for the component to not be mounted do to slow down of parsing location into props is not an issue as the component no longer has to be reversed prop drilled from redux state channel settings component rendered by modal manager, channel settings modal is now rendered within the server container and has no need for complex prop passing.
    - Removed raw app pulling animations for user settings modal when closing the modal via click or esc press and used the appPullerRelease animation function which uses the same raw code but offers some protections against certain elements or styles being missing.

    - Created Error Boundary component to handle errors for channel settings modal.
    - Created Error Boundary loading screen which is the fall back component incase channel settings error out.
    - Wrapped channel settings modal in a error boundary fall back to error boundary loading screen and wrapped channel settings modal with a suspense with a fallback with the spinning cube animation loading screen used in channel settings modal.
    - Add more condtional protection for channel settings modal where if the current server id does not match the server id of the selected channel that owns that channel the modal is closed and the error boundary component is signaled this is activated on rare instances of server hopping but clicking channel settings during the delay between the switching of servers where the action to open channel settings executes as soon as the server room has full switched this used to crash the app and was a bit more easily to be executed when channel settings opened from modal manager as the algorthim to parse the current path to obtain the needed data would sometimes not be fast enough to execute in time before the render and crash, the switch from props to state helped significantly and reduce crash occurence significantly however, the addition of a loading screen to render in placement of fetching the needed props before rendering or if the channel does not match the loading screen will load and attempt to fetch the data and re-render the modal. now the physical channel is passed into the redux state to be used but the server ids dont match outright close the modal in order to prevent unauthorization of editing a channel. the need to do a fetch of the channel when opening the channel settings causes a slow down also a glitch where closing the modal to fast causes the channel settings modal to overlay the app and try to re-render when it should close, these changes for just using state allow these rare occurencies to be furthered impossible to occur.
    - Fixed performance issue in server settings modal that was similar to the performance issue in channel settings related to delcaring and using the svg icon that is converted into a MUI SVGIcon component within the component itself. 
    - For channel nav bar passed the physical channel to ensure better protections of server hopping issues.

    - Moved file test bench 8 which which was the test bench file for the development of the new server user options modal to deprecated.
    - Removed ReactToolTip import and component in every active component in the app, due to the massive changes of the npm package react tool tip upgraded from ~v4 to ~v5.2 where the npm package has gone under massive changes which includes a huge overhaul on how the component works its implementation and its abilities all of which required the removal of the react tool tip import library in favor of tooltip instead (package can be import as Reacttooltip as aliasis but was skipped as the need to build the reacttooltip component in most components is not needed as much). The library now allows a single tooltip component routed at the root component of the application to be able to be called on any component within the app to show a tool tip for it without the need to created multiple tool tips for each component itself the only time a component needs its own tooltip its due to styling differences or if the component has muliple tooltips that vary in styles i.e. a single component with 3 different styled tooltips from the root tooltip needs 3 individual tooltips for it  unless it is used else where in the app those tooltips can be mounted at root. However most tooltips are ran and called to spawn from the main root tooltip mounted at the file _STRIFE_CORE_ (basically app.jsx) the only exceptions are specialized tool tips that have a special rendering, for example have a svg in its body or using the special render prop which targets elements in a list, or if the tooltip is needed in a modal which almost all modals except 1 are no longer rendered through modal manager component or within the calling component itself but called to be rendered through the REACT_PORTAL component which appears off the main dom and cannot be accessed by the main tool tip to be shown (it shows behind the modal).
    Also the need to conditionally and dynamically render tooltips based on conditions is not very friendly in react tool tip v4 as it requires a reacttooltip rebuild function to be called to rebuild to tool tip to get the tooltips to appear properly due to changing conditional rendering, also the large amount of reacttool tip components have been reduced which leads to slightly faster run times and previoulsy reacttooltip components where being created for each element in a list i.e. a list of 50 items lead to 50 individual reactTooltips being built which is not needed one tool tip with the right functionality and conditional logic can be used for all items in a list which speeds up rendering time signifcanltly and reduces any performance issue due to this. (one reacttooltip component takes about 1ms to load but on a page where the user inside a seerver they own and has a list of 50 servers, 50 members, header bar, channel nav bar with 50 channels (25 voice, 25 text), user nav bar messages and message control components can which hundreds of tool tip components i.e (317 in this example)being generated and render whenever they are triggered when one can be used almost all components). So attempts have been made to clean up ReactTooltip components an replace them with either a call to the main tooltip or to their own tooltip in each component in the app.

    - Created Styles for Mega Upc Modal which have many shared styles between server user options modal and mini current user profile card.
    - Deleted core.jsx file replaced with an actual used file _CORE_.jsx which is the main apps routing of components which goes as follows root (contains provider, hash router, store, and app) -> app (routes to auth pages for sign up login and splash page redirects to /$/ (_CORE.jsx) once signed in) _CORE_.jsx is much different than the previous used core.jsx as that file was never used, and is differerent from the previous app.jsx as before app.jsx runs all the routes through it but do to major styling differences including certain assets that must be present in the app when signed in cause scaling and styling issues for the splash page to make this simply the routing for all logined in required componentss be routed in another container also when signed in Core_cable runs on path /$/ but this path was reserve only for this but made sense to run all logged in components routes to it as well as a bunch of util functions so _CORE_.jsx runs core cable and routing to all logged in required components. this also replaced the makeshift CORE.js file which runs through a container but returns no jsx and runs only the core cable functions now this functionality in placed in _CORE_.jsx and returns the routes of all logged in required components in the app.
    - Created Container file for Mega UPC modal.
    - Created Jsx file for Mega UPC modal.

    - Added mega upc modal to view the current users profile to be rendered from user nav bar which can be opened from going to the mini upc current user card and clicking on the users avatar circle that shows the hover hint view profile. The modal itself for the current user prevents any of the tabs from being selected (they are not rendered) and any relation ship buttons are not rendered for the current user just the about me tab. Soon the modal will be added an rendered in a few other areas of the app including, clicking on the user name in dmServer header nav bar for one to one dm chats opening server user options modal in both dmServer and server member lists and clicking on  a user from the pending friends list.

    - Fixed to bug in sessions where errors would havve a chance to remain when click links that cycle between login and register by passing a function to when clicking on the link to check if they are any errors if so clear them. they are 3 links that switch between the login and sign up forms, already have an account, forgot password, and register.
    - Removed unused errors function in sessions form.
    - Removed commented out deprecated select options for the birthday input for sessions form, it has been replaced by the mui version and the old select options for birthday input have already been backed up to deprecated folder.
    - Fixed a bug with the homepage when switching between friends list tabs  would completely overwrite state due to not returning the previous state.
    - Addressed tiny warning issue when the no friends modal appears and the user clicks on the add friend button a tiny warning would pop up if the current location is the same, it has been addressed by checking if the current location is the same beefore warping, else close the modal.
    - Addressed a solution to the nofriends modal when teleporting to activate the add friends page if the current location is the same as the location we want to teleport to props.history will not push at all to the path and if teleporting is successful pushing again to switch back to add friends if the user went from '/$/channels/@me/' to '/$/channels/@me' history will push but the state to move to add friends page will not so in order to fix this the following was changed in the useEffect in the homepage that checks for the togglevalue (teleport value) if it is true run the changes, removal of the setState for the tablist and replaced it with the opentab function passing in "add_friends" which resets all tabs and then opens the passed in tab, this is used instead of the direct setTabstate as it allows moving to the add friends tab through the nofriends modal regradless of the current tab the user is in, it usually assumes that the online tab is open so it wont work for the other tabs. second once the value teleportvalue is true and add friends is switched to we replace the history state variable with an empty hash as the useEffect to switch between tabs by the nofriends modal only works when the teleport value changes. Third in nofriends modal 2 condtions are used checking if we are not at the path to teleport to push to '/$/channels/@me/' else if we are at that path push to '/$/channels/@me' which allows the modal when clicking on the add friend button to always switch to the add_friends tab regardless of the current tab or homepage tab or if the nofriends modal is opened from DmNavBar or HomeHeaderNavBar.
    - Changed the functionality of not friends modal where instead if the friend request was already sent and the other user opens the modal and clicks the send friend request button it closes the modal and does nothing, now it approves the friend request instead.
    - Added a useEffect to check to see if edit friendship modal is open in online friends list page if true using jquery add a hoverState class to maintain the hover styles when the modal is open on that selected friend as prior opening the modal would remove the hover styles. once the edit friendship modal closes another jquery function is ran when the condtion for the edit friendship modal is open returns false removes the hoverState class.
    - Added a useEffect to check to see if edit friendship modal is open in all friends list page if true using jquery add a hoverState class to maintain the hover styles when the modal is open on that selected friend as prior opening the modal would remove the hover styles. once the edit friendship modal closes another jquery function is ran when the condtion for the edit friendship modal is open returns false removes the hoverState class.
    - Made a switch in Not friends modal to allow async request using user state and core cable sending friendship updates to allow buttons to change depending on friendship types including if the modal is open and the other user accepts the friend request the modal will close through using state and useeffect instead of using props.
    - Moved old version of Not friends modal that uses primarly props to deprecated.
    - Fixed a bug in the home page when switching between tabs would completely overwrite the tab state due to not returning the previous state.
    - Fixed a bug with mega upc modal when switching between tabs would completely overwrite the tab state due to not returning the previous state.
    - Created a new hook called useCloseModalonESC in close modal hooks api util which takes in a bool usestate modal class name and exit transition class and listens for the esc press and applies the transistion class to the modal and using a promise close the modal at the end of the animation at near perfect timing.
    - Added Resync current user function to resync current user props when visiting the nitro store incase they are invited to dmServer and prevent them from being booted to the intrusion loading screen if they click on it from the nitro store.

    - Adjusted wrapper layer for channel settings modal.
    - Created a new hook called useCloseModalonOutSideClick in close modal hooks api util which takes in a bool usestate modal class name and exit transition class and a ref attached to the modal and listens for a click outside the modal and applies the transistion class to the modal and using a promise close the modal at the end of the animation at near perfect timing.
    - Added Mega Upc Modal to be mounted to server members list.
    - Added Mega Upc Modal to be mounted to pending friends list.
    - Added selectedfriends and toggle state to select a pending user to parse as the user to be viewed in mega upc modal in pending friends list.
    - Added Mega Upc Modal to be mounted on dm server header nav bar for one to one dm chat rooms which can be called by clicking the users name in the dm header nav bar.
    - Added animation trick to Mega Upc modal when clicking on the mutual friends tab and clicking on a mutual friend instead of just re-rendering with the selected friends props an jQuery function is ran to disable animations above the main modal layer then with a settimeout switch the current viewed user, set the tab back to the about me section and another jQuery request is ran to remove the disable animations to reactivate the opening animation of the modal to give the illusion that the modal closed and opened again without having to complicate the process to achieve a similar visual effect.
    - Made some style changes in order to ensure the spinning cubes are properly centered when clicking mutual friends or mutual servers tab in mega upc modal.
    - Created a new hook called useCloseModalonESCWSubModals in close modal hooks api util which takes in a bool usestate modal class name and exit transition class and a bool to reference if the current modal has an sub modals active. The function listens for the esc press and applies the transistion class to the modal and using a promise close the modal at the end of the animation at near perfect timing. if however a submodal is currently open the esc listener is locked and does not exit out of the modal till the submodal closes and then waits for the next esc press and closes on that one if no submodals are open. It uses a similar functionality that is shared with how settings modals handle esc when any of their submodals are open, but this is for non settings modals and modals that do not occupy the entire screen. The functions bool to check if a submodal is open is optional and has a default value of false and the listener can be used even if a modal has no submodals to open, just leaving that parameter blank will allow it to work as the useCloseModalonESC hook which these two function will be replaced and be combined together.
    - Created A new Version of editFriendship modal but for use in the Mega Upc modal which handles creating a message, deleting friend, blocking and unblocking a user, and copying the user id. Uses styles from the original edit friendship modal.
    - Created Mega User friend options modal.jsx
    - Created Mega User friend options modal container.
    - Attached new useCloseModalonESCWSubModals listener onto mega upc to allow the normal closeonESC hook to be attached to mega upc user options modal to allow the options modal to be closed on esc without closing the mega upc modal once the options modal is closed the mega upc modal can be closed on esc through the useCloseModalonESCWSubModals hook.
    - Changed the way the onclick listener to open the mega upc modal in pending friends list works instead of calling it on the main friend-index-item div and call it on the inner friend-index-item-wrapper-inner div which allows it to be called onClick and render the modal without interfering with the action buttons as before clicking on the action buttons also opens the modal with this specification the modal does not open when clicking on the action buttons.
    - Added an extra condition to one of the useEffects in mega upc that resyncs the current viewed users props when that users relationships with the current user changed is to when the user selects the user to view in the mega upc and clicks on the mutual friends tab and clicks on the another user to view from that list which in turn switches the member and memberstatus usestates to load that user for the mega upc and does a fetch for this user to add to redux state to the user entities state if the mega upc modal is being used in a dmServer or server and the number of members has changed the dm or server resyncs which removes the current viewed user from the user entities redux state if the currently viewed user is not a member of the current server or dmServer as the resync replaces the users state with the members of the server/dmServer which means any action within the modal that involves relationships will cause errors as the user is not in the entities user state and cannot run the changes the user reducer does. To address this an added change to the useEffect that resyncs the current viewed users props is to add an addition condition to check if the user being viewed is not in the user entities state and the components member.id exists fetch the user again and add it back to the users entities state which then allows all relationship interactons in the modal to work as normal.
    - Added Core Cable function calls to Mega Upc Modal relationship and create dm functions to allow the modal to interact asynchronously with any other area of the app  the has friendship actions and show up to the viewed user and they can then send back any interaction data back to the current user to have live changes in front of them this also applies to the mega modal upc if the other user has it open.
    - Added Core Cable function calls to Mega User options Modal relationship and create dm functions.
    - Added a props.fetchUser when clicking on a user in the mutual friends tab in mega upc modal to add that user to users entities state to allow that user to be interacted error free.

    - Since the change to use the newest version of ReactToolTip library v5.2+ bugs have been apparent most notably the tool tip sometimes remains if the mouse moves to fast off screen so to address this issue all the each almost all components will receive its own tooltip as before with the exception that instead of one tooltip per item it will be 1-3 per component where it will handle most of the items needing a tooltip, since using v5 most of the non modal tooltips have all been using the root tooltip, now the change will be for components to have their own tool tip component and using manualy isopen and setopen states to control the showing and hiding of the tool tip to ensure tooltip hanging is to a minimal. only components that suffer mostly from this problem will be using this fix.

    - Moved a protype version deprecated of the server message control using raw svg code to deprecated folder.
    - Moved a protype version deprecated of the server message control using new svg react icons to deprecated folder.
    - Solved the message control expansion problem after months since development of the expanding message control that expands for more options for a message by holding shift to open it it has been moved to deprecated to be used later as after look at how discord employees there method it seems that there method uses a listener that eventaully will target all message controls for each messsage on the page. Hover this version that was built controls only the message control component that is currently being hovered over and does not expand any previous hovered buttons but at the problems lied in the fact that it uses a focus and blur to achieve this which causes problems such as stop auto scroll on loading a chat room and the mouse is in the middle of the message list it stops the auto scroll and scrolled to the current hovered message and also takss away the focus of the chat ref input for the text area. This was ssolved by enabling the preventscroll on focus to true to stop the auto scrolling hover it does not stop from taking away the auto focus for other important elements. At the moment this is a near perfect solution and beats out discord implementation but due to the fact that the focus becomes diverted the method to employ 2 listener functions on mouse enter and mouse leave allows for the text area to remain focused while being able to control the component however just like discord any hovered message where the control component is hovered  will be controlled and be activated when not even hovering over that message at the moment. Basically just like discord a chat room with 20 messages hovering over 10 of those messages will register an event listener to that message to listen when the mouse enter listen for a key press of shift and then expand the message control component all previous hovered messages will be opened as well where as the custom  ref based solution targets one and only one at a time and removes the lister when the mouse leaves the message. the discord listener method will be used until a viable solution to fully handle the ref methods downsides in achieved.

    - Reworked how dmMessages will render in dm chatroom, dm_Messages now will render in a more compressed form where any new messages from the same user are sent within the span of 5mins (300 seconds) between the last message they sent with no other user messaging in between it will render all those messages in a compressed form where the compressed form only shows the dm_messsage body and no user name, avatar or time stamp header but will show a timestamp to the left of it if the message is hovered over. this gives the illusion that the dmMessages are part of the orginal first message the user sent 5 mins ago. The first message a user sends every 5 mins or in between messages of other users renders normally giving user name, timestamp header and avatar along with dm Message body. the follow up messages give the illusion of a continuation of the first message.

    - Added a ref to the edit dmMessage form so one it is open in addition to focusing on the input ref but also focus and scroll to the dmMessage edit body into proper view, discord does not do this and clicking on edit follow up message there is a 50% chance where when the edit form opens you will by also hovering over the message that is ontop of the one you are editing.
    - Finally rendered chat message dividers properly for dmMessages where message that where sent over a 24 hour period will be seperated with a divider stating the date of when those messages where sent.

## Backend Changes

- Discord does allow channels with name of more than 100 characters long but instead of erroring out it splices the name after the 100 character and creates it. So changes to the backend to prevent channel if the name fails to fall in a specified range between 1 and 100 characters.
- Added a return of friend info through friend show  jbuilder.json file to potentially allow the friendship state to fully sync with the user state when
when friend actions are executed. (Friend actions orginate in the user state as the natural way to meet new users is through this state and actions such as creating a friendship is using data from the user state to create the friendship while the friendship state is used to refer to all friends/ relationships with statuses of -1, 1,2,3) of the current user in certain modals as it is not volatile like the user state. The user state changes constantly as switching between servers, and dmServers the user state becomes filled with users that are members of those entities which would force users who are not friends with the current user to appear in lists/modals that use the users friends. the friend state renders all relations and filters out what is needed and shows the type of friendships without being modified by the users state. However many actions involving friendships do not get modded into the friendship reducer as the data returned by friend actions only partially contains data to complete further actions involving friendships the extra needed data comes from the user state so returning an extra portion of data from the friendships view file can allow friendship state to be used more in the app than just a hard filtered state. The potiental of this is yet to be tested and fully intergrated.
- Changed the rendering of messages when adding a member to a server only the first channel of the server will give a message about the invited person.
- Added a new function that passes in an array of member ids to grant server and channel memberships when inviting members of a group/dm server.
- Add another backend strife core cable action to parse members that where invited via a dm server in invite to server modal.
- Added new route to  call the new function to handle inviting multiple members (from a dmServer) at once from the invite to server modal in the server_memberships controller.
- Edited backend error messages for changing user passwords for when the new passowrd filed is blank.
- Fixed an error where removing phone number in remove phone number modal does not give an error on wrong password input due to not returning custom invaild password error.
- Edited Routing for fetching dm member status, changed the route and edited it to get_dm_member instead also changed the function attached to it to return the dm member data instead.
- Added a new route to check if a dm_member is still a member of a dmserver attached the route to dmServers instead of dmMembers to bybass naming it a generic /api/"generic name"/ route in order to bypass the get route needed the id of the object itself and needing to execute different functions or return different data this passes a bool value to indicate if membership is true or not without passing all the dmServer membership data instead which in the future will be larger.
- Added a new route attached to dmServer to receive dm membership data the functionailiy is the same as the show for dm membership but more dedicated to the current dm server that dm membership belongs to.
- Added a new Route to obtain server membership data of a server member.
- Added a new route attached to servers to obtain server membership data of a server member similar to the show server membership route/ function but more dedicated/ attached to the server the membership belongs too.
- Added new route to obtain a bool value indicating if a server member is still a member of a server.
- Create function to check if a user is still a member of a server.
- Create function to check if a user is still a member of a dm server.
- Added a change where injecting multiple members into a server by inviting a dmservers members to the server would cause a stall if the list of added members reach over 30 although this scenerio is impossible as dm servers have a max of 10 members reducing the amount of renders is needed. the re-renders is caused by the amount of new welcome messsages for each new member of the server with a re-render of the server to show the new added member. So a new welcome message function is created for injecting so many members at a time it welcomes all the new added members to the server in one messsage with all the new members names.
- Backed up server update function to deprecated prior to implementing snack bar.
- Replaced server update function with considerations for snackbar implementation able to parse removal of icon after updating and filtering out the removal icon bool from update params.
