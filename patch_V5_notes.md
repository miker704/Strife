# PATCH NOTES V5.00

## Future additions and pending changes
  
- Preparing to update to React v18
  - Changes will require fixing setInvervals, setTimeouts, modals that popup on within components other than the ModalMangerContainer.

- Action and process flow of banning and kicking users from a server or a dmServer will be reworked and
    be optimized by the Core Cable anaylzing the location of said user deciding the best course of action on whether
    a user should re-receive all their dm/servers or just a single one. The hope is also to reduce and eliminate problem areas on re-renders such as channel messages re-rendering a previous or newly received server/channels messages for half a second before reverting back to the proper messages.
  - many more

- Will be adding the new shop page.

### DmServer Plans

- Dmserver can manually be deleted via clicking the x icon next to it (creator only, leave the dmServer if a member)
  - (Anticipated) DmServers that become group chats (3-10 users) removing a user when they are 3 remaining deletes the dmServer in order to prevent a   duplicate chat of the same individuals regardless if it exists already or not. Change will be to check if there is a dm between those remaining two users if it exists the dmServer will be deleted if it doesnt deletion is aborted and the 3rd member that was being removed will be removed normally.
  - One to One chats when clicking on the new show user profile icon will render a profile card of the user.

### Server Plans

- Server Banners, Channel and Server descriptions which can be vieweds on the explore servers page
  - Explore Servers page will render a servers banner and server description if the server owner has added them instead of the default description and
  banner (if server has an avatar it gets rendered as a banner in the explore servers page)
- Servers will now have their theme type assigned via the backend,
  -Thus the channel creation for them will be moved to the backend to reduce redux calls for all the channels created and just receive the server itself which will give all the channels with it.
- Allow Servers to have no channels and be able to render to users when reloading the page and signing in.
- Allow the deletion of general channel,  a server with no channels leads to rendering no servers.
- Server Folder Bubble servers within servers
- Allow servers to be dragged and placed (requires placement values)
- When creating a server 2 channel catergories for a default server, voice and text are created and those channels are then inserted into those catergories.

### Channels

- Ability to give channels a description.
- Allow channels to be private, thus requiring an invite to that channel
- Allow the deletion of general channel.
- Channel Categories (channel that contains channels).
- Allow channels to be dragged and placed (requires placement values).
- Add new channel types including quick access member list, Q&A. etc
- Voice channels will have a complete different rendering scheme yielding no member list instead of a side acordian where text messages can be viewed.
- Voice channels for servers will now feature calling.

### Messaging as Whole

- Be able to message chain (reply to a comment)
- @ a user/ mention a user - (with upgrading to rails 7 this will be more hassle free to implement correctly)
- Inviting a user as Non Demo or admin account should work normally as in it creates a dm and with an invite to join.
- emojis
- Message/ notification inbox intergration
- Default message for channels and dm servers to be changed to match more of discords.
- Allow messages to send images
- Allow a url parser, anaylze if a text matches a url and provide a small modal/ component to wrap out send
link if possible.
- Allow url parser to embed youtube videos.
- Display edit, read status for messages.
- Allow dmMessages to be part of a server where the relationship is a server invite.

### General/Util

- Attempts to address draggable containers
- Context menus across the application
- Add Moz kit values to every style as FireFox is currently now unsupported as many styles glitch out in the browser. Microsoft edge, and Google Chrome are the only support browsers.

### Video / Voice Calling

- Re-add just voice only calling to dmServers.
- work on creating a unique room for individuals to talk in a dmServer also allowing more than users to talk at once current limits is 1 to 1 conversations.
- same will be implemented for servers, Servers have voice and video call disabled as the current state of the app interferes with this working and
the need to create a private room is need to prevent unwanted members from entering a call. (note multi web call where previously possible but could not be done on command and would randomly occur when the goal was never to 3 or more callers at once also due to certain limitations of rails and deployment platforms normal one to one chat is already stressful on app performance and webRTC has given multiple warnings on the number of ice canidates it can process even though the api can handle many callers at onces)

    - Added an important fix to loading screen skip due to react 18, due to the ProtectedRoute conditional check to push to the dashboard if a user is logged in else push back to the login screen, initially with react 17 upon signing in a promise is used on successful sign in to push to the loading screen which would dispatch some system utils to redux state however, with React 18 being faster it enforces the condtional check of protected route and overides the promise and pushes to dashboard and activates the refresh loading screen skipping the dispatching of system utils. so a temporary fix at the moment is to induce a settimeout in the sign in success promise to push to the loading screen slightly later which when at the reresh loading screen the condition there is if the route is towards the loading screen, to deactivate the refresh screen and render the loading screen instead.
